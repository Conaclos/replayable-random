/**
 * Ultra-High-Entropy (UHE) PRNG proposed by Gibson Research Corporation.
 * See https://www.grc.com/otg/uheprng.htm for more details.
 *
 * UHEPRNG is based on Alea (a Johannes Baag√∏e's PRNG).
 *
 * UHE uses 1536 bits of entropy (48 * 32bits).
 * In this implementation, the entropy is stored in an array of
 * unsigned integer 32bits. The original implementation uses an array of
 * float 64.
 *
 * The period of the PRNG is close to 2^1556.
 * This number is too large to fit in a float 64.
 * Details: using a = 1_768_863 as prime number and n = 1536 bits of entropy
 * we have a period of: a * 2^(n - 1) - 1 ~= 2^21 * 2^1535 = 2^1556
 *
 * Note that the hashes are differtenly computed.
 * This leads to distinct sequences of random numbers between
 * this implementation and the original one.
